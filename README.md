# Shape-From-Shading-Photometric-stereo
**Photometric stereo** The input to the algorithm is a set of photographs taken in known lighting directions and the output of the algorithm is the albedo (paint), normal direction, and the height map.

Steps to execute the code
*Download the Folder and Copy it in your Matlab Folder.
*Execute eval_code.m This will generate the albedo, Surface normals and Height Map.
*Change the subjectName in eval_code.m  to see output of different subjects listed in comment
*In eval_code.m modify the integrationMethod to observe the results of various methods. Allowed methods are listed in the comment.

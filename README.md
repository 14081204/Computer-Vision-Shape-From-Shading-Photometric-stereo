# Shape-From-Shading-Photometric-stereo
Photometric stereo The input to the algorithm is a set of photographs taken in known lighting directions and the output of the algorithm is the albedo (paint), normal direction, and the height map.
Steps to execute the code
1) Download the Folder and Copy it in your Matlab Folder.
2)Execute eval_code.m This will generate the albedo, Surface normals and Height Map.
3)Change the subjectName in eval_code.m  to see output of different subjects listed in comment
4)In eval_code.m modify the integrationMethod to observe the results of various methods. Allowed methods are listed in the comment.
